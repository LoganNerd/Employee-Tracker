# Employee-Tracker

This is an application to track employees in a database using mysql!

## Summary
I started with creating the server to hold all the logic behind asking the user what they would like to do with the software wether it be viewing
tables or adding to them. I then created the seeds which holds the data I want to be presented when selecting options and then I created the employee
database which describes what I want people to see when they view the employee table such as salary, title, id, and department id. 

## How to use
To run my application, you should download the code, open in intergrated terminal and "npm start". You'll be presented with the options to view employees, roles and department or add to the 3.
